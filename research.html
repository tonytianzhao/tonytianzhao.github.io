      <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Numerical modeling of sediment carrying capacity (depth-averaged saturated suspended sediment concentration) in shallow coastal seas (Main participant, in collaboration with Dr. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qian_Yu7">Qian YU</a>)</span><br>
      <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span>
      <div style="text-align:justify;">
        <p> Sediment carrying capacity has been widely used in hydraulic
          engineering by Chinese engineers since 1950s, in order to represent
          the intensity of fluid-sediment interaction. Most of the previous
          studies focus on the establishment of empirical formulae, on the basis
          of in-situ observation data sets acquired in rivers, estuaries and
          shallow coastal seas. However, there could be difficulties in
          transplanting such specific formulae to other cases, as well as
          interpreting the physical processes behind. Hence, it is crucial to
          figure out the mystery via further numerical studies, based on theory
          of sediment dynamics.</p>
        <p>Sediment particles with a phi number over 2.75 (finer than 148.65μm)
          meet the condition that their critical friction velocity is no less
          than their settling velocity. Under this circumstance, sediment
          particles are carried by the current as suspended load. In our model,
          based on the assumption of steady uniform flow, sediment carrying
          capacity of specific sorts of sediment is measured by depth-averaged
          saturated SSC, and can be derived from numerical calculation. Cohesive
          and non-cohesive sediments are treated separately.</p>
        <p>Currently, numerical calculation and data analysis are in progress.

          Reconstruction of the return period - intensity relationship for

              <td style="text-align:justify;">Return period of coastal extreme events (e.g. typhoon,
                hurricane) works as a critical parameter in coastal engineering.
                However, it was usually estimated on the basis of instrument
                measurement (up to 100a), leaving a regret that Quaternary
                climate change, especially sea-level change, has not yet been
                completely considered. By combining high-resolution coastal
                sedimentary records and numerical modeling of sediment dynamical
                processes, a frequency-intensity curve of coastal extreme events, with a domain on ka scale, can therefore be established.<br>
